Use these templates when preparing your AAGI reports, presentations, and other documents.

- **[AAGI Report](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIOfficeTemplates/raw/main/AAGI%20Report.dotx)**: An AAGI-themed template for project 
  reports. Use this template for the 'large' (i.e., project conclusion) reports, such 
  as major milestone reports for Research & Development investments, or analytics
  reports to clients for Service & Support investments.
- **[AAGI Interim Report](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIOfficeTemplates/raw/main/AAGI%20Interim%20Report.dotx)**: An AAGI-themed 'small'
  report template, designed for shorter (i.e., 3-4 page) reports. Use this template
  for summary or interim reporting to clients or for investment milestones.
- **[AAGI Document](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIOfficeTemplates/raw/main/AAGI%20Document.dotx)**: A general AAGI-themed document template.
  Use this template for miscellaneous documents such as guides, overviews, 
  checklists, media releases, memos, and others.
- **[AAGI Presentation](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIOfficeTemplates/raw/main/AAGI%20PowerPoint%20Presentation.potx)**: AAGI-theming for
  PowerPoint presentation slides. Use this template for presentations showcasing
  your AAGI project work, or when representing the AAGI brand at events.


## Installation & Usage Instructions

The AAGI report and presentation templates for Microsoft Word and Microsoft PowerPoint
can be installed easily on Windows 11 with the following steps.

1. Download the .dotx and .potx template files from this GitHub repository to your
   computer (e.g., by clicking the following links):
   - [AAGI Report.dotx](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIOfficeTemplates/raw/main/AAGI%20Report.dotx)
   - [AAGI Interim Report.dotx](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIOfficeTemplates/raw/main/AAGI%20Interim%20Report.dotx)
   - [AAGI Document.dotx](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIOfficeTemplates/raw/main/AAGI%20Document.dotx)
   - [AAGI PowerPoint Presentation.potx](https://github.com/AAGI-AUS/AAGIOfficeTemplates/raw/main/AAGI%20PowerPoint%20Presentation.potx)
2. Open Microsoft Word and open the _File&rarr;Options_ window. Navigate to the 
   _Save_ menu and note the _Default personal templates location_, if one is
   listed, as shown. (If no directory is listed, you can choose whatever
   directory you like and enter its directory path here to set it as the
   default templates location for Microsoft Office.)<br><img src="assets/README_graphics/install_wordoptions.png" alt="Find the Custom Office Templates directory png" width="700px"/>
3. Copy and paste the template files that you downloaded in Step 1 into that
   default templates location directory.<br><img src="assets/README_graphics/install_templatesdirectory.png" alt="Download the templates to the Templates directory png" width="365px"/>
4. Close Microsoft Word (as well as any other open Word windows).
5. Open Word again and it should load the new templates. Navigate to _File&rarr;New_
   and scroll down to select _Personal_ and the AAGI templates should now appear
   in the list for you to use.<br><img src="assets/README_graphics/install_wordtemplates.png" alt="Templates appear in the New Document list png" width="700px"/>
6. Similarly, when you open Microsoft PowerPoint and navigate to _File&rarr;New_,
   the AAGI Presentation template should appear in the _Personal_ list of
   templates.<br><img src="assets/README_graphics/install_powerpointtemplates.png" alt="Templates appear in the New Presentation list png" width="503px"/>
7. Click the template in the list to start a new document using that template.
   Replace the placeholder text as appropriate (e.g., replace `<Client>` with the
   name of the client for who the report is being written, replace `<University>`
   with the name of your University, replace `<AAGI-XX>` with your specific
   AAGI node, and so on).

**Note 1**: The templates use, but _are not bundled with_ (for trademark reasons),
the Proxima Nova Medium font. For the best aesthetics, it is highly recommended
that you install the Proxima Nova Medium (OTF) font when using the document and
presentation templates. AAGI staff should contact the AAGI administration team if
they need help with getting and installing this font to their computer.

**Note 2**: When you first start a new document with the template, dates may
appear malformed like `0 XXX 0000`, as shown:
<br><img src="assets/README_graphics/install_dates.png" alt="The Date appears malformed before first save png" width="500px"/><br>This is normal. That `0 XXX 0000` bit
is the _SaveDate_ field, which does not exist yet until you have saved the document
for the first time.
Once you have saved the document, from that point on the field will always show
the date of the most recent document save, as expected.
